            		<h1 class="project-page-heading-item"> Before and After </h1>
						<img src="myprojects/Before & After (Guy Running).jpg" />
							<p> The "Before and After" image was an assignment for a Digital Foundations course in which I had to find an existing image and alter it in a way that changes the original intent, feeling, and message that the image originally exudes. I chose an image of a man running a marathon in what appeared to be a speedo, and I could only think that an appropriate place to place this man would be the beach. So, I found an image of a beach altered its color (hue and saturation), lighting, sharpened it, and I also did the same with the man. I edited both images mostly in Photoshop but as far as sharpening goes that was in Adobe Camera Raw. Lastly, the assignment also encouraged students to write a paragraph that explains the story of the "After" image, in which case I wrote something along the lines that the gentleman in my image was a surfer who just lost his board in the water after a terrible storm knocked him off a huge wave and the reason he is running is to get back to his car to escape imminent danger (in summary). In conclusion, the project was a lot of fun and I definitely would be interested in returning to something like it at some point in the future. </p>
					<h1 class="project-page-heading-item"> Human Figure </h1>
						<img class="tertiary-container" src="myprojects/Human Figure.jpg" />
							<p> This project was also taught by Professor Stein at Housatonic Community College and the idea was to create an image that showcased the human figure in an interesting and creative way. This assignment did not have a mandatory requirement to use only yourself (the photographer) but did allow for the capturing of another individual, but I still chose to capture myself as I thought it unlikely that I would have a volunteer to showcase their body in any form of "nudity". I chose to place myself in a pose that revealed as much of my body as possible but that also sent a message of strength but with fear. I have a weird take on what I define as interesting and "artistic" but I am unashamed of my ideas and I simply chase something I feel is unique and no one has done before, and even if they have I do it in a way I feel is still different. In summary, the assignment was one which required much of an understanding of the human figure and I learned how to better capture a specific composition. </p>
					<h1 class="project-page-heading-item"> Self Portrait </h1>
						<img class="tertiary-container" src="myprojects/Self Portrait.jpg" />
							<p> The Self Portrait was a project for a photography course I took at Housatonic Community College taught by Professor Stein. The idea was to take a photo that captured a message and it had to be a self-im-age, this message could be anything you wanted but the picture in essence had to signify a specific idea. I chose to capture myself in a dark pose because I felt the message I wanted to portray about myself is that I am haunted by my own isolation and so I am always in the dark. Therefore, I assumed a position that made me feel like I am best ex-pressing how deeply troubled I get from constantly being alone. I wanted to show how chilling it is being confined and feeling trapped in a life where you are secluded from genuine love and embracement. I feel I could have done a better job looking back at it, perhaps adding walls that are compressing my body (sort of a claustrophobic effect) or having so much empty dark space around me that it elevated just how alone I really was. To be honest, the goal I was trying to capture was more artistic than realistic, but a deep part of me really did feel that way and so I wanted to express that very human emotion. In conclusion, the assignment was very enjoyable in that it took a lot of creativity and thinking outside the box to compose.</p>
					<h1 class="project-page-heading-item"> The Boxer </h1>
						<img class="tertiary-container" src="myprojects/The_Boxer_Movie.jpg" />
							<p class="projects-page-bottom">The Boxer is a project I created at the University of Connecticut at the Stamford Campus. This assignment was for a Digital Foundations class taught by Matthew Worwood. The goal of the assignment was to create a poster for a movie using a green screen with a talent in front of the green screen. I chose to do the assignment by using a make shift green screen I made using table cloth, I then used a ceiling light to light my talent. Later I edited the photo of my talent in adobe camera raw and then placed it into Photoshop. I also found various images online and placed those into Photoshop as well. I then adjusted the contrast of the overall image along with a bunch of other tweaks here and there, such as the hue, saturation, and sharpening to really put my image together. The final product, came out to be what is displayed on this screen.</p>
