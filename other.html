						<p class="projects-page-bottom"> The NASA video is one I designed for my Digital Foundations class taught by Matthew Worwood at the University of Connecticut (Stamford Campus). The objective of the assignment was to create a video that synchronized flawlessly with a fixed audio track provided to us by Matthew. The video could not exceed 60 seconds and had to be at least 30 seconds in length. The most challenging part of the assignment was not only matching the words of the audio to the video, but finding a musical piece to fit in the background of the video so as not to overtake the audio provided. One thing I learned from this assignment is how excruciating it can be simply to make film and understanding how words relate to picture and how sound/mu-sic relates to moving images. Overall, it was a challenge to create and I must say I am pleased with the results. </p>
