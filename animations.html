						<p> This assignment was for an animation class taught by Matthew Worwood, at UConn Stamford, under the DMD program. The goal of the assignment was to create an animation using the technique of 2.5D Parallax Effect. This effect involves turning a still image into a seemingly moving scene by using a displacement map and/or the pin tool in a editing program like adobe after effects. </p>

						<p class="projects-page-bottom"> This assignment was for an animation class taught by Matthew Worwood, at UConn Stamford, under the DMD program. The goal of the assignment was to create an animation using tracking and keying. The idea was inspired by the Iron Man movie in which seemingly future technology was shown that made it seem as though this technology was readily available in our day and age. It was all of course, animation. </p>
