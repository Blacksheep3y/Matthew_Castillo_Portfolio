            		<h1 class="project-page-heading-item"> Cartoon Drawing </h1>
						<img src="myprojects/Cartoon Drawing.jpg" />
							<p> This assignment was for a Graphic Design course taught by Professor Favret at Housatonic Community College. The idea was to design a comic book page or a manga page, using Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop, I chose to go with the latter. The first step I took was coming up with a general story I can use to start drawing from, so I came up with this "CIA" scenario in which a woman pulls up on the sidewalk next to a man and tells him to get into the car. The man listens to this crazy woman but, only because she is "beautiful" and so the story continues from there. There was a one week time limit for the assignment so the story was never able to be finished but I did manage to complete what was required for the posted assignment. </p>
					<h1 class="project-page-heading-item"> Landscape Drawing </h1>
						<img class="tertiary-container" src="myprojects/Landscape Pastel Drawing.jpg" />
							<p> The Landscape drawing was a drawing I did for my Drawing II course at Housatonic Community College taught by Thomas C. Brenner. The assignment was simply to search for an existing photo of a landscape (any landscape) from real life and then draw that landscape from scratch using chalk pastels. So, in essence I was copying a photo by drawing it. The process for me was personally one I found went easy, whether my drawing skills had improved tremendously or I simply got "lucky" I don't know, but I never found myself appreciating any of my drawing works until I took this course. Specifically, I found myself appreciating and admiring this work of art more than any other for the fact that I felt I really improved in my drawing ability. In addition, I must mention that I stared the drawing with a sketch (still referencing the photo, not tracing over it) and then for some reason I could see every-thing "outlined" and proportioned correctly, and so I was able to easily fill in the blanks. </p>
					<h1 class="project-page-heading-item"> Portrait of Professor </h1>
						<img src="myprojects/Portrait of Professor.jpg" />
							<p class="projects-page-bottom"> This Portrait was one I did of my Drawing II Professor Thomas C. Brenner, and it was of course, for Drawing II. The materials we were allowed to use ranged from chalk pastels, to oil pastels, to charcoal, vine charcoal, and even pencils. I chose to draw with chalk pastels because I felt it was better in capturing the colors present in his face. The process was like any other drawing process, a lot of measuring of proportions using your pencil/tool and then a rough sketch of the shadows/light areas of the face, but I did it as Brenner would say I would "start with the lighter parts of the subject and work your way dark". Other than that, I tried so hard not to smudge as he felt it really destroyed the natural stroke of the pastel/drawing utensil. Overall, it was a project which required a lot of focus and constant attention to the subject being drawn, but well worth the effort.</p>
